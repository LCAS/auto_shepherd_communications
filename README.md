# Group 2 – Baa-ndwidth Team

## Goal: 
To establish and encourage data communications between groups, including communication hardware and protocols for their use. 

## Preparation in Advance:  
- Follow the preparation instructions on [Getting-Started]()
- Some materials on LoRa: [LoRa De-Mystified](), [LoRaWAN in 40min]()
- Some materials on nRF:  

## Activities:
### Primary Activity: 
`ROS2 Group Messages` – Working with the other groups, establish protocols for the messages being shared between groups and construct a ROS2 messages package for all groups to share. 

### Secondary Activity:
`ROS2-LoRa Bridge` & `ROS2-nRF Bridge` - Developing on the provided LoRa and nRF modules, configure serial to radio protocols to enable long range infrastructure-free communications for connecting to the robots in-field.  

### Stretch Activity:
`Empirical RF Propagation Study` - Perform a radio frequency survey across Riseholme Campus, in this, mapping signal attenuation of LoRa and nRF. 

## Outcomes:
By the end of the week, group members will have developed and deployed a radio communication package on a robot in the field. Alongside this, the empirical RF propagation study, in combination with assessments on the viability of LoRa under the developed protocol, will go towards publication. 

## Future Engagement:
Moving beyond, members will have opportunity to engage further in mesh infrastructure deployment over Riseholme / Brayford, and connection across Lincoln.
